   <p align="center">
    With the love of travel in mind, this project was created to serve as a one stop shop for travel junkies to get and/or stay excited for their next trip. The functionality is very straightforward; enter the name of a city that you've always dreamed of visiting, the dates that you're availabe to go there, and voila! The dashboard will return the price of a roundtrip flight to that destination, and some other useful info to get your imagination flowing about your next adventure!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

## Tools

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): A tool for managing source code
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A source code editor
* API Keys for: 
    <br />
    * Openweather API
    * Unsplash API
    * Skyscanner API

## Setup

As this application requires several different API keys, if you wish to only view its functionality, it is recommended to visit the [Live Demo](https://dinardavis.github.io/travel_app/), instead of running the application locally. 

However, if you do wish to adapt or make contributions please do the following:

* With git clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.

    [Download the ZIP from this location](https://github.com/dinardavis/spacex_clone), or run the following command to clone the files to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dinardavis/travel_app
```
* Once the files are on your machine, open the _travel_app_ folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

* Sign up and obtain API keys for:
  <br />
    * [Openweather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
    * [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers)
    * [Skyscanner API](https://rapidapi.com/DataCrawler/api/skyscanner50/)

* Add API keys and secret to /.env file using the format:

    REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=[API KEY HERE] <br />
    REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_API_KEY=[API KEY HERE] <br />
    REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY=[API SECRET KEY HERE] <br />
    REACT_APP_FLIGHT_API_KEY=[API KEY HERE]

* In the project root directory run: 

```bash
npm install
```

then...


```bash
npm start
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

In this project I have included various error handling for instaces of failed API fetch retrievals. (Which happen frequently with the flight info. Apologies, but it's the best API that I could find for this data.) Also covered are cases where the user inputs a city that is not included in the working data set.

</div>


## Future Iterations

Additionally, included in the sidebar are examples of several widgets that could be added to the project in the future such as a user login component to personalize and store the search data, travel advisory alerts, and a foreign currency tracker. Currently, the user will be greeted with a "Coming Soon" notification when interacting with any of this planned enhancements.
